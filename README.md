# CNN-Gesture-Recognition

As part of this repository we develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote.
he gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:

1. Thumbs up:  Increase the volume
2. Thumbs down: Decrease the volume
3. Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds 
4. Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds
5. Stop: Pause the movie
 
Each video is a sequence of 30 frames (or images).

The data is in a zip file. The zip file contains a 'train' and a 'val' folder with two CSV files for the two folders. These folders are in turn divided into subfolders where each subfolder represents a video of a particular gesture. Each subfolder, i.e. a video, contains 30 frames (or images). Note that all images in a particular video subfolder have the same dimensions but different videos may have different dimensions. Specifically, videos have two types of dimensions - either 360x360 or 120x160 (depending on the webcam used to record the videos). Hence, you will need to do some pre-processing to standardise the videos. 

Each row of the CSV file represents one video and contains three main pieces of information - the name of the subfolder containing the 30 images of the video, the name of the gesture and the numeric label (between 0-4) of the video.
